Section 4.11: When a Java program attemts to divide one integer by another integer it does not take into consideration of any fractions or decimals. If such calculation is done the fractional part will be truncated and only hold an integer value with no decimals or fractions. You can avoid this by making your types into doubles which work with decimals or you can type cast the integers into doubles. 

Section 4.12: Control statements can be stacked to one another by connecting the exit point of one to the entry point of the next. Control statements also may be nested by placing one inside another.

Section 4.13: Counter controlled repition would be appropriate for calculating the sum of the first 100 positiver integers because we know ahead of time how many repitions there will be. The program would a while loop to help keep track of how many times it has repeated so that it could end. I would use a sentinel-controlled  for calculating the sum of an arbitrary number of positive numbers. I could use a certain number that the user would enter that would mark when to stop adding the integers. 

Section 4.14: In preincrementing a variable the the value to that variable will be raised by one then the new value of the variable is used in the expression it appears. When postincremeting a variable the value that is current is assigned to the variable and is then incremented by one. 

Section 4.15:
	a. No semicolon after (age>=65);
	   The quotation mark goes inside the parenthesis
	
	b. Total should be initialized to zero
	
	c. Missing the braces inside the while loop {}
	
	d. It is an infinite loop. Perhaps change ++ to --. Also missing the closing braces at the end }.
